/* Rough overview of what the soldiers will do: 
 * If enemies just in attack range, attack
 * 		Signal if you attack so others can come help
 * Otherwise kite (if enemies can hurt you)
 * Otherwise look for enemies and move towards any you see
 * Otherwise continue along a goal location you got in a message
 * 		If you're close enough or have spent a while on it, reset goal location
 * Otherwise (if you don't have a goal location) check your messages for one
 * Otherwise just move around randomly
 * (Yes there's other stuff and it's not all pretty)
